       "description": "Now available in paper, The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter is the first book-length analysis of J. K. Rowling's work from a broad range of perspectives within literature, folklore, psychology, sociology, and popular culture. A significant portion of the book explores the Harry Potter series' literary ancestors, including magic and fantasy works by Ursula K. LeGuin, Monica Furlong, Jill Murphy, and others, as well as previous works about the British boarding school experience. Other chapters explore the moral and ethical dimensions of Harry's world, including objections to the series raised within some religious circles. In her new epilogue, Lana A. Whited brings this volume up to date by covering Rowling's latest book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.",

From his earliest public appearances as a mischievous redheaded toddler, Prince Harry has captured the hearts of royal enthusiasts around the world, while his marriage to Meghan Markle has only endeared him further. In Harry and Meghan, Britain's leading expert on the young royals offers an in-depth look at the wayward prince turned national treasure. Nicholl sheds new light on growing up royal, Harry's relationship with his mother, his troubled youth and early adulthood, and how his military service in Afghanistan inspired him to create his legacy, the Invictus Games. She uncovers new information about Harry's past relationships and reveals the true story of his romance with Meghan Markle, the smart and spirited American who captured his heart. Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love features interviews with friends, those who have worked with the prince, and former Palace aides. Nicholl reveals behind-the-scenes details about the run up to the couple's spectacular wedding day, their first tours as a married couple, and their preparations for the arrival of the youngest new royal. Harry and Meghan is a compelling portrait of the Royal Family's most popular royal couple and the story of the most gripping royal romance in a decade. Previously published as Harry: Life, Loss, and Love.",

       "description": "J.K. Rowling has drawn deeply from classical sources to inform and color her Harry Potter novels, with allusions ranging from the obvious to the obscure. “Fluffy,” the vicious three-headed dog in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, is clearly a repackaging of Cerberus, the hellhound of Greek and Roman mythology. But the significance of Rowling’s quotation from Aeschylus at the front of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a matter of speculation. Her use of classical material is often presented with irony and humor. This extensive analysis of the Harry Potter series examines Rowling’s wide range of allusion to classical characters and themes and her varied use of classical languages. Chapters discuss Harry and Narcissus, Dumbledore’s many classical predecessors, Lord Voldemort’s likeness to mythical figures, and magic in Harry Potter and classical antiquity—among many topics.",

       "description": "An eye-opening, monumental biography of Prince Harry by a veteran journalist on royal affairs who accompanied the prince on his royal duties for a year and was granted privileged access to his home in Kensington Palace. Once a reckless rebel and now a respected role model, Prince Harry is one of the world's most popular royals and the force behind giving the British royal family a twenty-first century makeover. How has he done it? This insightful new biography is a three-dimensional look at what Harry is really like as a person, both on and off royal duty. It is written by distinguished journalist and author Angela Levin, who accompanied Prince Harry on many of his engagements and had exclusive access to him at Kensington Palace. The book unwraps the real man behind the camera, and his own perceptive insights. It delves into his troubled childhood and the lasting effect of losing his adored mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, so young. It explores his rebellious teenage years and the key defining moments that have enabled him to face his demons and use this experience to help others who struggle with mental, emotional and physical pain. Angela Levin found a complex man who has inherited his late mother's extraordinary charisma and is determined to \"make a difference.\" After finding the love of his life in Meghan Markle, and in anticipation of their marriage this year, this is an investigation into the real life of Prince Harry.",
